      <h1> About the Daisy-chan Experiment </h1>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for participating in this experiment. We're testing out if
        this idea of talking to a character would work.
      </p>
      <h2>Why are we conducting this?</h2>
      <p
        >We're building a new platform, a new place for characters to live, here
        on the Web. We're trying to see if this idea would be a success or
        not.</p
